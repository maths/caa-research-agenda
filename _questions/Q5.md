In formative assessments, students typically get feedback on their response; the task designer has to make many choices about the linguistic content of this feedback.



## What motivates this question?

There is a risk of a feedback gap between the task designer and the students, who do not understand or cannot engage with the information given to them. Possible issues include:

* the feedback is too technical or in condensed mathematical language instead of a ‘language for learning’;
* steps in elaborated feedback, such a worked-out example, are too big;
* the feedback does not help students develop their ability to choose and use mathematical methods and techniques in other tasks.

See also Shute's (2008) review of research on formative feedback, which highlights issues such as the use of elaborated feedback and the complexity of feedback.

## What might an answer look like?

The question could be addressed through experimental studies in which various forms of feedback are evaluated in various mathematical domains with a focus on their effectiveness. A first step toward this would be identifying a range of linguistic features that are currently used to different extents in feedback.

It may also be fruitful to carry out qualitative investigation based on interviews with students; e.g. recent work has explored students' interpretations of written feedback on proofs (Byrne et al., 2018). Robinson, Loch & Croft (2015) used a student survey to explore how students perceived generic feedback on a mathematics assignment provided via screencasts. Kalyuga (2015) explored a cognitive load perspective on balancing learner guidance and feedback.
