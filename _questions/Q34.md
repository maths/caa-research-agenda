E-assessment systems allow the possiility of randomising question parameters and offering different students different variants of questions, or indeed different question variants to the same student for repeated practice. Does such practice promote deep learning of the concepts, or does is simply promote "pattern spotting"?


## What motivates this question?

Martin and Greenhow (2004) say repeated practice on similar questions with study of resulting feedback allows students to develop deep understanding, by learning what underlies a question type. However, Rønning (2017) says students experiment by trying out different variations on their input when it is marked incorrect, suggesting this does not encourage deep learning. Can experimenting with input in an e-assessment system develop conceptual understanding, and, if so, how? It is claimed by some that immediate feedback decreases students’ independence, need to check their own answers and control of their learning. How do we avoid immediate feedback producing dependency among students when we are trying to develop independent learners? 

Lowe and Mestel (2020) note that a student taking repeated parameterised version of a question stated that "I think that answering them repeatably allows to get a view on
a broader picture behind a problem, instead of focusing on the calculation techniques, which become
more obvious then."

## What might an answer look like?

This may involve interviews with students who have used system permitted mulitple attempts at variants of questions to establish the insight they gained from the experience, and the reasons for attempting the question multiple times.

This question should also be considered in light of the literature on interleaving (e.g. Rohrer, Dedrick & Stershic, 2015), and, literature regarding repeated practice for developing a deep understanding of mathematical concepts (independent of the e-assessment format, e.g. Anderson, Reder & Simon, 1999).
