## What motivates this question?

This question is motivated by the need to aid practitioners in developing pedagogically-robust assessment tools for their own classroom.

The framework of Mejía-Ramos et al. (2017) provides a model of the types of questions that can be asked, from the perspective of paper-based tests. Bickerton and Sangwin (2021) made some further suggestions of practical approaches that can be taken with current e-assessment tools.

## What might an answer look like?

One answer to this question might focus on design principles for writing automated assessment questions in this area. Researchers might draw on the Design-based Research methodology to iteratively develop theoretical principles and practical artefacts in a cyclic process. Ruth Reynolds and Ben Davies (University College London) have proposed a workshop to this end at the 4th International STACK Conference hosted by TTK University of Applied Sciences in April 2021. 

Another answer to this question might focus on convergent validity, comparing student performance on various question formss/types to other existing measures of students' understanding (see [Q49]({% link _questions/Q49.md %})).
