What do students do when they engage with a mathematical question presented by the e-assessment system? Do the use paper-and-pencil to make calculations, do they do that mentally, or do they use other resources? Maybe even more importantly, how do students engage with the automated feedback that they receive? Do they read it? How? What do they do next?
Igor's team in Auckland has started tackling questions of this sort.

## What motivates this question?

More often than not, task and feedback design is based on assumptions regarding how students interact with what e-assessment system has to offer. Generating an empirical base of evidence on how students engage with e-systems seems paramount.

## What might an answer look like?

The answer might look like trajectories and profiles that account for students' reactions to offered questions and feedback.

A possible approach would be to analyse observations of students as they work on e-assessment tasks, similar to Dorko (2020) or Jordan (2012). This could be supplemented with analysis of a larger group of students' interactions with e-assessment, using logs generated by the system (e.g., Chen et al., 2018; Roth et al., 2008).
