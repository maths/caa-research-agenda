Student make mistate for a range of reasons, from the trivial to the conceptual. We are interested in conceptual errors, so we can improve our teaching, and perhaps reveal tricky topics. We are interested in errors made interpreting questions, so we can author less ambiguously. Conceptual errors are likely to be different for each area of mathematical knowledge.

Common errors may be due to

- Careless errors: slips in working
- Errors of intepreration: students answered the wrong question
- Mathematical errors made when answering the question

We are probably more interested in the later categories, but to revieal those issues, we may first need to elimitate more trivial causes of error.



## What motivates this question?

An answer to this question might help:

- Creator's of Assessment systems produce systems which avoid technical and input issues, to the assessment outcomes depend on the mathematics.
- Teachers may gain a better understand of what are tricky topics, that need to be taught with care.
- It may lead to better techniques for question authors, to create questions that are not liable to misinterpretation.
- ... and where feedback for students should be added for common errors.

## What might an answer look like?

Online assessment systems store all responses by all students in a database. This is a large pool of data that could be mined.

There are various papers that have attempted to examine student work for misconceptions (Jordan et al., 2003; Greenhow & Gill, 2004; Walker, Gwynllyw & Henderson, 2015). Note that Walker, Gwynllyw & Henderson (2015) completed a post-assessment analysis of e-assessment data and found a large number of errors that were made quite infrequently by students, suggesting pre-empting student errors may be quite difficult in practice.
