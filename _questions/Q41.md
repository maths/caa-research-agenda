## What motivates this question?

There is now a large body of research showing that active learning approaches are more effective than traditional lecturing (Freeman et al., 2014), including studies of mathematics teaching (e.g., Maciejewski, 2015).
As lecturers are encouraged to adopt active learning approaches, while at the same time e-assessment is increasingly prevalent, it is important to understand whether there are differences in the way that e-assessment operates in the two types of learning environment.

On the one hand, there are reports of positive experiences when using e-assessment as part of a course using a flipped classroom model (e.g. Sangwin, 2019).

On the other hand, Cybinski and Selvanathan (2005) compared the experience of two groups of students enrolled in an introductory statistics module -- one group was exposed to the traditional lecturing style, while a second group was exposed to a flexible learning environment. The results of the survey investigating the influence of each learning mode  on students’ performances suggest that the group studying under a flexible learning environment experienced a high level of test and performance anxiety.

## What might an answer look like?

Experiments could be used to compare groups of students experiencing active/traditional learning environments, in terms of their engagement with and performance in e-assessment. This could extend existing work comparing outcomes between active/traditional conditions (e.g. Maciejewski, 2015; Code et al., 2016) to consider e-assessment.
