## What motivates this question?

Students' strategies have been studied in previous work (e.g. Iannone et al., 2011) but computer-aided assessment brings additional constraints that warrant further investigation. For instance, students may immediately be able to sketch an example with the required properties, or orally describe the relevant features, but may struggle to formulate this as an algebraic expression that is suitable for entry into the CAA system. As a specific example, they may wish to use a piecewise function but may not know the notation to use (if it is even possible in a given CAA system).

## What might an answer look like?

This would likely require in-depth qualitative investigation of students' strategies, e.g. through observations or clinical interviews (as in Iannone et al., 2011).

The mathematical topic is likely to be an important factor, as suggested by the example of students being able to sketch a function but not write a corresponding algebraic expression. So perhaps part of the answer would involve an audit of topics where this is most likely to be an issue (perhaps generating a list of mathematical objects/operations that are not currently well-supported in e-assessment, that developers of e-assessment systems could look to address).
