## What motivates this question?

The motivation is a desire to replicate, as far as is possible, some of the behaviours of expert teachers, who often seek to limit their interventions to the minimum necessary (Foster, 2014), and engage students in conversations, rather than just brain-dump the whole thing at once.
Thus, the question is about the extent to which students' learning can be better supported by giving feedback through a "process of scaffolding and fading, of moving from directed through indirect prompts to spontaneous use by the student" (Mason, 2000, p. 99).

This has some connection with previous work on adaptive assessment (e.g. the DIAGNOSYS system developed at Newcastle in the 1990s; see Appleby, 2000) where the feedback and tasks are displayed based on a decision tree.

## What might an answer look like?

It could be that it is a prohibitively huge amount of work to design and populate a decision tree for real scenarios. Indeed, reflecting on a decade of development work on an automated "intelligent tutoring system", Anderson et al. (1995) acknowledged that they had "totally abandoned our original conception of [automatic] tutoring as human emulation".

Alternatively, it might be that in areas where a few common misconceptions dominate, the design work is relatively straightforward.

Addressing the question may involve:

* a survey of what topics might be amenable;
* a “framework” for implementing questions in a certain topic, e.g. “you should include feedback on this possible misconception” (e.g., see Wake et al., 2016, Table 2) or a template for decision trees;
* experimental work to compare approaches;
* investigating whether particular students need less support over time (i.e. they are internalising more of the decision tree for themselves)
