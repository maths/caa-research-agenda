## What motivates this question?

How students engage with feedback and what they do next, whether it promotes positive learning behaviour, is clearly important to close the loop of assessment for learning. Yet apparently little is known about what students do when they get feedback. Do they read it and engage with it? What do they do next? If they got a question wrong, do they attempt relevant learning and reattempt the assessment item? If they get positive feedback, do they set themselves new learning goals to advance to the next level of the topic? 

A recent "critical scoping review" of research on student perceptions of assessment feedback (Van der Kleij and Lipnevich, 2020) provides useful background information. Out of 164 studies included in the review, only 4 were based in mathematics. Similarly, from the summary of each study presented in the supplementary materials, a search for "computer" suggested that very few of the included studies were related to automated feedback (studies 43, 89, 90, 148).

## What might an answer look like?

Some different approaches are possible:

- A questionnaire asking students to report their behaviour could be used.
- It could be that tracking within an integrated learning and assessment system could be used to track what students do when engaging with feedback and what they do afterwards.
- Direct observation of students as they work through tasks could give insights that are not possible from self-reports or from analytics data (e.g., Jordan, 2012).

The framework presented by Van der Kleij and Lipnevich (2020, Fig. 3) could also inform the selection of methods, particularly as they highlight methodological concerns with survey-based research.
