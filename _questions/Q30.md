There are choices to be made about the timing of e-assessments, particularly when there are multiple assessments taking place throughout a course. What impact do these different choices have on students' learning?



## What motivates this question?

Previous research (Uner & Roediger, 2018) has investigated the impact of placing assessment questions at the end of a chapter versus throughout a chapter (using biology as a context). This informed the design of an online mathematics course making extensive use of e-assessment (Sangwin & Kinnear, in press), where the course materials include e-assessment questions throughout as well as having weekly summative tests.

A related aspect of timing is about feedback - should it be made available to students immediately after an attempt, or after a delay? There is mixed evidence on this point, with some large-scale work underway to investigate (Fyfe et al., 2019). There may be scope for more fine-grained investigation of this question in mathematics assessments specifically, for instance to investigate whether any effect is moderated by the types of questions (from the range typically seen in mathematics assessments).

## What might an answer look like?

First, it would be worthwhile to gather examples of different approaches that are used in practice.

Then, experiments could be used to compare different approaches -- for instance, comparing the use of shorter more frequent assessments throughout a course, with fewer assessments (e.g. at the end of substantial topics).
