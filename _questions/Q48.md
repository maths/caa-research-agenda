This is rather a broad question, which has a number of aspects.



## What motivates this question?

Immediate feedback has long been seen as one of the advantages of e-assessment, particularly when human resource for tutoring is so scares. Kluger and DeNisi (1996) provided some evidence on when feedback is and is not effective, but this needs to be translated into the e-assessment context.

## What might an answer look like?

Some very specific research studies looking at the effectiveness of timing, types of feedback, regimens for allowing/encouraging repeated attempts once feedback have been given would all deepen our understanding of e-assessment and student learning more generally.
