Common approaches include typing mathematics, often using the syntax of an underlying CAS, or a menu-driven system. These can be difficult for students to learn and are not well-aligned to the process of producing mathematics offline. It may be worthwhile investigating alternative methods for input of mathematics.  Such methods might include the following.

* Typed expressions.
* Drag and drop equation editors, including special mathematical symbols.
* Optical character recognition of handwriting.
* Mechanisms for encoding the meaning of a complete mathematical agrument, including the logic of deduction.



## What motivates this question?

An informal linear syntax for mathematics is impossible to precisely define (Sangwin, 2015), so systems typically use some non-standard syntax (Lawson, 2002), the mathematical typesetting language LaTeX (Foster, Perfect & Youd, 2012) or the syntax of an underlying CAS.

An answer which is mathematically correct may be marked incorrect due to syntax issues. Jones (2008) points out that the student may not know whether the problem is mathematical or typographical. Approaches to avoid such errors impacting marks include the e-assessment system rejecting inproper input, use of practice questions or a process called "double submission", in which input is interpreted and displayed in two-dimensional format for checking by the student before submission (Sangwin, 2015). Some systems build up as the user types it (Foster et al., 2012). These methods are somewhat adequate, but clearly present a barrier to engagement for students and risk adding extra learning requirements unrelated to the assessment objectives (Lawson, 2002). 

There is interesting work in touch interfaces for mathematics following approaches used for non-Latin alphabets (Nakamura & Nakahara, 2017; Shirai & Fukui, 2017) and in converting hand-written mathemaatics into computer input (Pacheco-Venegas et al., 2015). These topics should be investigated for more recent references. Recent developments in handwriting recognition apps such as Mathpix and photomath show promise. Speech should also be investigated.

## What might an answer look like?

A desk research project could usefully investigate the current state of the literature and test available software for mathematics input and the capabilities of current e-assessment systems to take input from such software.
