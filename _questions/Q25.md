## What motivates this question?

The features of different e-assessment systems have advanced hugely -- and new systems have been introduced -- since the survey by Sangwin (2013). Some recent developments include:

* "AI-Assisted grading" (Gradescope, 2020), where an AI system automatically clusters short written responses from different students that it judges to be similar.
* "Flick input" that provides a more efficient way to enter mathematical expressions (Nakamura & Nakahara, 2017).
* Web-based tools for delivering interactive classroom activities, such as Desmos Classroom (Button, 2020) and [GeoGebra Classroom](https://www.geogebra.org/m/hncrgruu).

## What might an answer look like?

One approach would be to extend the survey of Sangwin (2013) to more recent systems. This could present a collection of case studies of different developments and how they can be applied to university mathematics.

Another way to address the question would be through developing and evaluating protoypes of new e-assessment features being applied to university mathematics.
