      <p>I am Assitant Professor of Teaching in the Mathematics department and Durham University, and for the last two to three years have helped implement automated electronic assessments as a formative component of our assessment in our Undergraduate programmes. During this time I’ve written questions (primarily in STACK) for a variety of modules and helped others in the department learn how to use STACK to write questions for their own courses. I’m particularly interested in the efficacy of automated formative assessments as compared to more traditional assessment methods.</p>

      <p>André Heck earned MSc degrees in mathematics and chemistry, and a doctoral degree in mathematics and science education. He is senior lecturer at the Mathematics department of the University of Amsterdam, mostly teaching mathematics to students in life sciences and computer science, and coordinating mathematics deficiency courses and exams. His research area is the application of ICT in mathematics and science education, at upper-level secondary school level and bachelor university level. Since 2005 he works on digitial teaching, learning and assessement of university mathematics. Currently he uses the SOWISO environment for online and in person teaching. An example of online precalculus materials is available at https://uva.sowiso.nl/courses/home/en</p>

      <p>I have worked at UWE Bristol since 1995 holding the roles of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Associate Head of Department (Cluster Lead for Mathematics) and am currently an Associate Professor in Technology Enhanced Learning.  I have promoted and enhanced the student learning experience in two significant ways; firstly by working with Dewis, the in-house algorithmic e-Assessment system developed by Dr Rhys Gwynllyw, to create assessment and learning resources in key STEM fields and secondly by, in collaboration with Dr Tim Swift, estabishing the successful espressoMaths service.  I am currently an Associate Professor (in Technology Enhanced Learning), University Learning and Teaching Fellow and an HEA National Teaching Fellow.</p>
