# Writing sessions

These sessions are intended to give some motivation, and space in your diary, to do some writing about the questions on GitHub.

You can pop along to any of the below dates, or even for part of one of them, to work on GitHub while others do the same.

## Thursday 25th February, 14:00-16:00

Run by Ian.

This session will run on Teams (sorry!) using the following link: https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZjBlMjEzZGQtOTE5YS00OGMwLTg5OWYtNDllNmU1ZDFhOTcx%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22cf264fc0-aeb8-449f-9054-82ce4454084b%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2243ae5ddf-5765-4f5c-85e4-d349d5f04259%22%7d

You have three technology choices to use that link: the Teams app, or Microsoft Edge, or Google Chrome (won't work on other browsers).
