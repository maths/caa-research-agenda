excerpt: "This collaborative project developed a shared research agenda for e-assessment of undergraduate mathematics, drawing on input from the community of mathematics education researchers and university teachers."

# Scope
The scope of possible research questions is broad, but has limits. In particular, questions should directly relate to computer-aided assessment of undergraduate mathematics:

* **Computer-aided** – relying on technology in a fundamental way;
* **Assessment** – concerning formative or summative assessment, rather than teaching or learning tools (though of course the line between these and formative assessment is blurry);
* **Of undergraduate mathematics** – based on topics or task-types which are relevant to mathematics as studied at undergraduate level, for instance in universities.

# Publication

In this manuscript, we summarise the process used to create the research agenda, and give an overview of the themes:
