I am currently undertaking doctoral research work on mathematical education and computing, focusing on the use of and the development of in-house algorithmic e-assessment system (Dewis) at University of the West of England. In particular, the research is focused on developing a method to detect Common Students Errors (CSEs) in Engineering Mathematics and to provide tailored feedback in the Dewis e-assessment system. More about the CSE Project can be found at <https://fetstudy.uwe.ac.uk/~bin-sikurajapa/dewis/cseproject/>. This project is supervised by Dr Karen Henderson and Dr Rhys Gwynllyw.
